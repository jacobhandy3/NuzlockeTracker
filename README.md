# NuzlockeTracker
 Basically I would always keep my Nuzlocke rules in like a txt file on my USB, but then I was too lazy to get it. Therefore, I'm building a website that can keep track of your Nuzlocke rules. It also tracks the pokemon you catch, start data, and end date because it needs more content. I also compile all that information into a "story" if you will because I thought that would be cool. This project uses postgresql for the database because i need to keep practicing with SQL. It uses Django as the backend because of Django's included admin system, this project doesnt need to be highly scalable, it supports faster development, and finally cause the security is built-in. I am also using ReactJS for the frontend because I need to learn it since its so popular and Angular is overkill.
